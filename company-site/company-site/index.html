            <h2 id="about">Welcome to SGC Design</h2>
                <p class="intro-text">Welcome to SGC Design, here you can find three web developers and designers who are able to create and design web pages for any business or client. We all have experience in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a web page that is up to date and meets current web standards. We also have experience working with clients and our projects that were made for them are displayed on this site. There is always more to learn in this industry so we are constantly challenging ourselves and trying to learn different things that clients would want on their website.  Making web pages is a huge part of our lives and we are always practicing to make sure we can have a better website than our competitors.</p>     
        
                <p class="intro-text intro-ex">SGC Design was not always a team, however. We all attended the same college and migrated together to form a solid and strong working web design/development team. Our goal is to become some of the best developers and designers in the industry so that we can please our clients and keep our name out in the public. We have received awards in the past for web pages that we have made. They were an award for an organized and responsive website while working for a company, and an award for creating a logo for another company that was used on their website and received great recognition by the public.</p>
        
                <p class="intro-text intro-ex">Other than working with web pages for a good portion of our lives we are also very knowledgeable on organizing work and meeting clientâ€™s standards. SGC Design is very cooperative when working with a client and we strive to achieve the exact requests that are given to us.  We look forward to working with new clients because we have more to show, and this is just the beginning.</p>
